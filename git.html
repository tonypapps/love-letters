        <h2>My Beautiful Git,</h2>
        <p>
          You are the one I've been looking for all my life. You are so perfect and easy to communicate with. I feel like you are so easy to get along with compared to some of the other programing software I have dated.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the moment we <span class="key-word">init</span> for the first time, my life changed. When we first met I introduced myself to you by <span class="key-word">configuring</span> my information. You accepted me at once and the rest is history.
        </p>
        <p>
          I simply adore your love of commitment. I understand that you usually want to prepare for committing to something new by <span class="key-word">add</span>ing to the que. You are so easy to <span>commit</span> to once we are ready to do so. You even have me attach a personal <span class="key-word">message</span> to every commit, which is not only helpful for remembering the occasion, but also so cute. Together you and I can go back and reminisce on these past commitments by looking at the <span class="key-word">log</span> of our love affair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I ever told you that one of your best qualities is your ability to <span class="key-word">branch</span> out and try new things. You even encourage us to <span class="key-word">checkout</span> multiple things without losing what we just did. If we both fall in love with a idea that was successul you are always there to help me <span class="key-word">merge</span> the two lifestyles. If I don't like something you aren't afraid to <span class="key-word">delete</span> that branch of thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I installed you into Atom you got even more beautiful as a package. I simply adore how you were able to visualize all the steps needed to commit to you and switch branches without having to memorize any good. You even enforce your rule about leaving you an adorable note so you never get angry and quit on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't believe there was a life before I met you. You have improved so much about me and I don't know how I will ever repay you. You complete me.
          </p>
